Help on method crop in module PIL.Image:

ccrroopp(box=None) method of PIL.GifImagePlugin.GifImageFile instance
    Returns a rectangular region from this image. The box is a
    4-tuple defining the left, upper, right, and lower pixel
    coordinate.
    
    This is a lazy operation.  Changes to the source image may or
    may not be reflected in the cropped image.  To break the
    connection, call the :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.load` method on
    the cropped copy.
    
    :param box: The crop rectangle, as a (left, upper, right, lower)-tuple.
    :rtype: :py:class:`~PIL.Image.Image`
    :returns: An :py:class:`~PIL.Image.Image` object.
